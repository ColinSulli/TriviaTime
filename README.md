EECS 493 | Team P03 | Final Project

FEATURES:
1. Start Screen: 
    - The user can select a "mode" which will change which sounds/tones are played for each key.
    - Once the user presses an alphanumeric key, the interactive mode is initiated.
    - 

2. Interactivity: 
    - Each keypress uses the same image for all modes (ex: "4" always uses "FIXME" in its animation).
    - Each animation of these images will be (random, deterministic? FIXME) and where the image is generated on the screen is random. 
    - "Hit [Esc] to exit" is clearly displayed at the bottom of the page so the user can go back to the start screen without having to refresh.
    - FIXME: mention the queue at the bottom
